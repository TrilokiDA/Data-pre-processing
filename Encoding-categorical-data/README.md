## Encoding categorical features

1. To convert categorical features to such integer codes, we can use the **OrdinalEncoder**. This estimator transforms each categorical feature to one new feature of integers (0 to n_categories - 1)

     - *Retains the order of categories when encoding **ordinal data**, which can be ranked or ordered. For example, education levels (high school, bachelor's, master's, Ph.D.) or temperature categories (cold, warm, hot).* </br></br>

2. Another possibility to convert categorical features to features that can be used with scikit-learn estimators is to use a one-of-K, also known as one-hot or dummy encoding. This type of encoding can be obtained with the **OneHotEncoder**, which transforms each categorical feature with n_categories possible values into n_categories binary features, with one of them 1, and all others 0.
     - *Considers the presence or absence of a feature when encoding **nominal data**, which has categories with no intrinsic order or ranking. For example, colors (red, blue, green), types of animals (mammal, fish, reptile, amphibian, or bird), brand names (Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Sprite), or pizza toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, onions).* </br></br>
     
     
3. **LabelEncoder** encode target labels with value between 0 and n_classes-1

## Column Transformer

- This estimator allows different columns or column subsets of the input to be transformed separately and the features generated by each transformer will be concatenated to form a single feature space. This is useful for heterogeneous or columnar data, to combine several feature extraction mechanisms or transformations into a single transformer.
